This project looked at the Boeing 737 MAX crashes as a case study in engineering ethics. Over Weeks 6 through 9, the assignments helped show how engineering decisions, company pressure, and weak oversight came together and caused serious safety problems. The case shows how focusing too much on saving money and moving fast can lead to poor ethical decisions.

In Week 6, the main ethical issues were identified. These included whether Boeing should have been more open about the MCAS system, required more pilot training even if it cost more, and stopped management decisions that put profits ahead of safety. This made it clear that the crashes were not caused by one single mistake, but by many choices that slowly made the system less safe.

Week 7 focused on facts and reasonable assumptions. Important facts included MCAS using only one angle of attack sensor, pilots not being fully informed about the system, and the FAA allowing Boeing to approve parts of its own design. When information was missing, assumptions were made about pressure inside the company and poor communication between engineers and managers. This showed how company structure can affect engineering decisions.

In Week 8, ethical rules and different viewpoints were discussed. Engineers are expected to protect public safety, be honest, and clearly explain risks. Boeing focused on meeting regulations and deadlines, while pilots and passengers expected full honesty and proper training. This showed the difference between doing the bare minimum and doing what is right.

Week 9 looked at real world limits that made ethical choices harder. Tight schedules, cost pressure, company hierarchy, and unclear oversight made it difficult for engineers to speak up. These issues help explain what happened, but they do not excuse the outcome. The case also showed that better safety culture, stronger oversight, and clearer communication could have prevented the crashes.

Overall, the Boeing 737 MAX case shows that ethical failures in engineering usually come from systems and organizations, not just technical mistakes. This project highlights the responsibility engineers have to protect public safety, even when facing pressure from management or competition.
